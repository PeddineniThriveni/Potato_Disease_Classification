# Potato_Disease_Classification:

**Project Description
This project is a web application for detecting diseases in potato leaves using deep learning. 
Users can upload an image of a potato leaf, and the system predicts the presence of a disease. 
The application leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and uses 
FastAPI as the backend server.
**Features:
- Upload images of potato leaves for disease detection.
- Predicts whether the leaf is healthy or infected with a specific disease.
- Built using a CNN model for classification.
- Backend server developed with FastAPI.
- User-friendly web interface.
- **Tech stack
- - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras
